In this guide, we’ll walk through how to set up Kali Linux as a management server for pfSense and an attack machine for penetration testing in your cybersecurity home lab.. Kali Linux is a specialized Linux distribution designed for penetration testing and security assessments, making it ideal for both administrative tasks and launching attacks.

### Why Use Kali Linux for Cybersecurity Labs?

Kali Linux is well-known for its comprehensive set of penetration testing tools, making it ideal for security testing, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation in a cybersecurity home lab. Setting it up as the management server for pfSense allows us to handle firewall and routing configurations efficiently while also enabling us to test the security of our network segments.

>pfSense will serve as the default gateway and firewall for the home lab. It’s important to boot the pfSense VM first, and once it’s running, the other VMs in the lab can be started.

### Step-by-Step Setup Guide: Installing and Configuring Kali Linux on Mac M1 Using UTM

#### 1. Download and Install Kali Linux

**Download Kali Linux:**
- Visit [Kali Linux Downloads](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images).
- Select `Apple Silicon (ARM64)` and choose the `ARM offline installer` for compatibility with UTM on your Mac M1.

_Insert Kali Linux ISO Image for Cybersecurity Lab Setup_

**Configure VM Settings:**
- **Memory**: 2GB RAM (minimum recommended)
- **CPU**: 2 CPU Cores
- **Storage**: 40GB (to accommodate tools and logs)
- **CD/DVD Image**: Set as the boot device and select the downloaded Kali Linux ISO.

_Setup Summary_

**Prepare for Installation:**
- Before starting the Kali installation, adjust the VM settings to prevent black screen issues. 
  - Click on the top-right settings icon in UTM.
  - Under `Devices`, click on `New Serial`. This will add a terminal, enabling console mode installation and preventing the black screen issue.
  - Under `Networks`, set the following to use the LAN interface resently configured:
    - **Network mode**: `Host only`
    - **Emulated Network card**: `virtio-net-pci`.

_Terminal integration_


**Install Kali Linux:**
1. **Start the VM**: Boot the VM for the first time, and the Kali installation menu will appear.
   - You will see two screens: one for the regular installation and one for the terminal installation. Minimize the regular installation screen.

    _Kali Installation_

2. **Select Installation Mode**:
   - Choose `Install` from the terminal installation screen.

3. **Proceed with the Installation**:
   - You will be prompted with various configuration options:
     - **Language**: Select your preferred language.
     - **Location**: Choose your location.
     - **Keyboard Configuration**: Set up your keyboard.
     - **Hostname**: Enter a hostname for your system.
     - **Domain Name**: Leave this blank for now.
     - **User Account and Password**: Create a user account and set a password.
     - **Clock Configuration**: Set your time zone.
     - **Partition Disk**: Choose `Guided - use entire disk`. Encrypting the hard drive is optional.
     - **Disk to Partition**: Leave this as default.
     - **Finish Partition**: Save changes to disk.

4. **Software Selection**:
   - For desktop environment, You may choose any preferred options.
   - Ensure that the installation of Kali tools is checked.

    _Software Selection_

5. **Complete Installation**:

   - Wait for the installation to finish. This may take some time.

6. **Post-Installation Steps**:
   - Once the installation is complete, **do not boot the machine** immediately. Instead, close the window and shut down the VM. This step ensures that you are not stuck in the installation process.
   - Remove the installation media (ISO Image) to boot into the newly installed system.

    _Remove ISO Image_

   - Also remove the Serial added to avoid always having the terminal when you power up the VM.

7. **Starting the VM**:
   - Boot the Kali Linux Machine for the first time and log into the user you created before.

    _Starting VM_

8. **Post-Installation Steps on Kali**:
- Boot the VM: Start the Kali Linux VM. Log in with the user account you created during the installation.
- Update the System: Open a terminal and run the following commands to update the system:

`sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade`

- Once the sources have been fetched, you will be asked if you want to continue. Enter Y and press Enter to start the update.

    _VM Update_

After the update is complete, run:

`sudo apt autoremove`
This command will remove unused packages.

- To enable clipboard sharing and resize the display, install the Spice Tools inside your brand-new Kali Linux:

Open a terminal and run:

`sudo apt install spice-vdagent spice-webdavd`

9. **Testing LAN Access and pfSense Configuration in a Cybersecurity Lab**
Run the command: 

`ip a`

 ![LAN on kali](/assets/images/kali/kali13.png){: w="400" h="200" }
    _COnfigure LAN Interface of Kali_

 The Kali Linux VM has successfully received an IP address from the LAN network and can access pfSense via the browser. We’ll cover that in the next module, along with completing the pfSense configurations.

    _pfSense Web Interface_


For UTM, if this doesn't automatically work, you can make adjustments to the `/etc/network/interfaces` file:

1. Open the file by running `sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces`.
2. Add the following lines:

   ```
   auto eth0
   iface eth0 inet static
     address 192.168.10.12
     netmask 255.255.255.0
     gateway 192.168.10.1
   ```

3. Save and close the editor.
4. Restart the network service with `sudo systemctl restart networking`.
5. Reboot the VM using `sudo reboot`.
6. Verify the changes with `ip a` or `ifconfig`.
