As someone passionate about cybersecurity, I’ve always believed that the best way to learn is by doing. After spending countless hours reading articles, watching tutorials, and taking online courses, I realized that the next step in my journey was to build my own cybersecurity lab—a safe, controlled environment where I could practice and refine my skills.

The idea for this lab was inspired by two blogs I stumbled upon during my research: [IP3C4C](https://ip3c4c.com) and [David Varghese's Blog](https://blog.davidvarghese.dev/). The detailed guides and practical approach laid out in those blogs motivated me to take the plunge and set up a lab of my own. This is the story of how I turned that inspiration into reality, and how it’s helping me grow as a cybersecurity professional.

### Why I Decided to Build a Lab

The world of cybersecurity is vast and complex, filled with ever-evolving threats and technologies. I knew that if I wanted to truly understand how attacks work—and how to defend against them—I needed to get my hands dirty. Reading about penetration testing, network security, and incident response is one thing, but actually performing these tasks is something entirely different.

I wanted a space where I could simulate real-world scenarios, test out different tools, and make mistakes without any consequences. This lab would be my sandbox, a place to experiment, learn, and ultimately become more proficient in the field.

### The Vision: A Lab for All Aspects of Cybersecurity

When I first started planning the lab, I knew it needed to cover a wide range of cybersecurity topics. I wanted to practice everything from offensive tactics (like penetration testing) to defensive strategies (like intrusion detection and response). I also wanted to include elements of network administration and system management to understand the full scope of what a cybersecurity professional needs to know.

After a lot of brainstorming and research, I settled on the following setup:

### Key Components of a Cybersecurity Lab

1. **Kali Linux (Management & Attack Machine)**: The Swiss army knife of cybersecurity tools. Kali would be my go-to machine for scanning networks, exploiting vulnerabilities, and managing the overall lab.

2. **pfSense (Gateway & Firewall)**: A robust open-source firewall and router. pfSense would control traffic between the different network segments, simulating the boundary between the internet and an internal corporate network.

3. **Active Directory Lab**:
   - **Domain Controller**: The heart of any corporate network, responsible for managing user accounts and permissions.
   - **Windows Clients**: Simulating real-world endpoints that attackers would typically target.

4. **Security Onion (Monitoring & Defense)**:
   - **Security Onion**: A comprehensive platform for intrusion detection, network security monitoring, and log management.
   - **ELK Stack**: For visualizing logs and alerts, providing insights into what’s happening across the network.
   - **Suricata IDS/IPS**: To detect and prevent potential intrusions in real-time.

5. **Target Network (Vulnerable Machines)**: A collection of intentionally vulnerable machines that I could attack and learn from.

### The Challenge: Building a Cybersecurity Lab on a Mac M1

Building a cybersecurity lab on a Mac M1 with limited resources, such as 8GB of RAM, posed unique challenges.I knew I needed to be strategic with my resources, carefully balancing the performance of each virtual machine to ensure that the lab would run smoothly.

### Choosing the Right Virtualization Software

Given the limitations of my hardware, I decided to use [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) for virtualization. UTM is optimized for macOS, particularly for M1 chips, and supports both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures. It was the perfect tool for running multiple VMs on my Mac without compromising performance.

### Allocating Resources Wisely

One of the first hurdles I encountered was figuring out how to allocate resources. With limited RAM and CPU power, I had to make some tough decisions:

- **pfSense**: 512MB RAM, 1 vCPU (Lightweight, as it mainly handles routing and firewall tasks)
- **Kali Linux**: 2GB RAM, 2 vCPUs (This VM needed more power since it would be doing most of the heavy lifting)
- **Domain Controller**: 1GB RAM, 1 vCPU (Essential for managing the Active Directory network)
- **Windows Clients**: 1GB RAM, 1 vCPU each (Used for simulating real-world endpoints)
- **Security Onion & ELK**: 2GB RAM, 2 vCPUs (Critical for monitoring and intrusion detection)
- **Vulnerable VMs**: 512MB RAM, 1 vCPU each (Lightweight machines to practice attacks on)

I had to keep in mind that running all these VMs simultaneously would strain my system, so I often had to juggle which machines were running at any given time based on what I was working on.

### Building the Lab: Step by Step

To give you a better understanding of the lab’s architecture, here's a diagram that outlines the setup. This diagram visually represents how each component interacts within the network, including the segmentation of different zones, IP addresses, and the flow of traffic through the firewall and monitoring systems.

This blog post is just the beginning of my journey. In the following posts, I will dive into each component of the lab, providing step-by-step guides on how to set them up, configure them, and integrate them into a cohesive cybersecurity practice environment.

Building this lab was an incredible learning experience. It reinforced the importance of hands-on practice in the field of cybersecurity. While the process had its challenges—particularly with resource limitations on my Mac M1—the knowledge and skills I gained were well worth the effort.

Going forward, I plan to continue expanding this lab, perhaps by incorporating additional security tools, including a dedicated malware analysis lab. The possibilities are endless, and each new addition will bring fresh opportunities to learn and grow.

### Conclusion

If you're serious about a career in cybersecurity, I highly recommend building your own lab. It’s one of the best ways to gain practical experience and develop a deeper understanding of the field. My journey was inspired by [IP3C4C blog](https://ip3c4c.com) and [David Varghese's Blog](https://blog.davidvarghese.dev/), and I hope this post inspires you to embark on your own journey.

Remember, the key to mastering cybersecurity is persistence and continuous learning. A lab like this provides the perfect environment to experiment, fail, learn, and ultimately succeed.

Happy Learning!
