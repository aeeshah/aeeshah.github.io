As someone passionate about cybersecurity, I’ve always been drawn to the practical side of things. Instead of just reading about concepts, I prefer diving into hands-on projects that bring those concepts to life. And what better way to learn than by setting up your own Security Operations Center (SOC) environment?

In this blog series, I’ll walk you through my journey as I set up and automate tools like `Wazuh`, `TheHive`, and `Shuffle`. These are essential in monitoring and responding to security incidents.  Here, I'll cover the installation of the tools and machines needed for this project. Let’s get started!

### The Big Picture: What We’re Building

Before diving into the setups, let me give you an idea of what this project will look like once everything is in place:

1. **Windows 10 Client Wazuh Agent**: This machine collects security-related events (logs, network activity, etc.) and sends them to the Wazuh Manager.
2. **Wazuh Manager**: Acts as a hub, analyzing and normalizing events from the Windows 10 machine and generating alerts for potential threats.
3. **Shuffle**: Enriches these alerts by correlating the data with threat intelligence platforms (think VirusTotal).
4. **TheHive**: Where incidents get investigated and managed by the SOC team.
5. **SOC Analyst’s Workflow**: Alerts flow to the SOC Analyst, who receives them via email or TheHive for further analysis and response.

It’s essentially an automated workflow where security incidents are tracked from detection to investigation and response. Sounds cool, right?

### Setting Up Our Virtual Lab

To bring this project to life, we’ll set up virtual machines for Windows, and utilize cloud services for Wazuh and TheHive. Since I’m on a `Mac M1`, I used `UTM` for Windows virtualization, and `AWS` for our cloud instances.

Let’s start with the setup process!

### Step 1: Installing Windows 10 on UTM

For our SOC environment, we need a **Windows 10 machine** to simulate real-world client activity. Here’s how I set it up:

1. Download the Windows 10 VHDX image [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64).

>I got mine from Satish Tiwary on youtube who found a working VHDX of windows 10 [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k0LmDIaJjAP2aMqqfRb0DD-8MiBl3RnZ/view)
{: .prompt-info} 

2. Launch your UTM application, and click `Create a New Virtual Machine`.
3. Select `Virtualize`
4. Select `Windows` as the Operating System
5. Make sure 
- `Install Windows 10 or higher` is checked 
- `Import VHDX Image` is checked.
- `Install drivers and SPICE tools` is checked. 
- select the `VDHX` you downloaded in step 1 and `continue`.

6. Allocate the necessary resources:
    - RAM: I chose `4GB `for smooth performance.
    - CPUs: Set to `2 CPUs`.
    - Storage: I allocated `64GB` of disk space to ensure enough room for Windows and additional applications. Click `save`.

7. Press `Save` to create the VM. Wait for the guest tools to finish downloading and press the `Run` button to start the VM.
8. Follow the Windows installation prompts to set up the OS.
9. Once Windows 10 is installed, you’ll have your first client machine ready to go!

10. Lastly to get access to internert:
    - Navigate to cd drive on the windows machine
    - You will see a few files, including utm-guest tools application.

        _Guest Tools on Windows 10 on Mac M1 using UTM_

    - Run the utm-guest tool application and wait for it to install compeletely.

   - When sucessful restart the virtual machine and you will have accesss to the internet on the virtual machine.ß 

### Step 2: Installing Sysmon

Once Windows 10 is installed, you can proceed with setting up sysmon on the virtual machine. Sysmon (System Monitor) is a powerful tool for logging system events. Here’s how I installed it on the Windows VM:

1. Download Sysmon from [Sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon).

2. Then head to github and grab a pre-made config file to ensure we’re collecting all relevant data. The config file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/blob/master/sysmonconfig.xml)

3. Copy the config.xml file to the Sysmon folder downloaded and enter the folder in Powershell.

4. Run the following command in `PowerShell (as Administrator)`:

   ```
   .\Sysmon64a.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml
   ```

>Sysmon64a works for UTM. Sysmon and Sysmon64 give a sysmon drive error.

5. To confirm that Sysmon is installed, look for the Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows >
Sysmon > Operational folder in the Event Viewer.

     ![Sysmon confirmation](/assets/images/SOC/soc6.png){: w="400" h="200" }

After confirming that Sysmon is installed, it’s time to set up the cloud components!

### Step 3: Setting Up Wazuh on AWS

**1. Launching an AWS EC2 Instance**

Start by creating an AWS account if you don’t already have one. AWS’s free tier is a great way to get started.

- **Log in to AWS Management Console** and navigate to `EC2`.
- Click `Launch Instance` and select `Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS` as the AMI.
- Choose the `t3.medium` or `t3.large` instance type. Ensure that you set up appropriate security group rules to control access.
- Storage: 20-50 GB SSD 
- Create a key pair for SSH access and launch the instance.

**2. Connecting to Your EC2 Instance**

Use the following command to connect via SSH:
```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
```

**3. Installing Wazuh**

Once connected, update the ubuntu machine using this command 

```bash
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y 
```

Once completed,iInstall Wazuh with the following commands:
```bash
sudo curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
```
After installation, you’ll receive credentials to access the Wazuh dashboard:

  ![WAZUH installation](/assets/images/SOC/soc7.png)
        _WAZUH installation on AWS Ubuntu_

```
INFO: You can access the web interface https://<wazuh-dashboard-ip>
 User: admin
 Password: <ADMIN_PASSWORD>
```

>The passwords also can be found in the ‘wazuh-install-files.tar’ file.
{: .prompt-info}

Now that Wazuh is installed onto the Wazuh server, it’s time to install TheHive on our TheHive server. 

### Step 4: Setting Up TheHive on AWS

**1. Launching Another AWS EC2 Instance**

Repeat the process to launch another **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS** instance.

**2. Connecting and Installing Dependencies**

SSH into the new instance:
```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
```
Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget gnupg apt-transport-https git ca-certificates ca-certificates-java curl software-properties-common python3-pip lsb-release
```
This dependencies are a prerequisite step before installing applications like TheHive, Elasticsearch, or other development tools.

**3. Installing Java, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch**

Install Java:
```bash
wget -qO- https://apt.corretto.aws/corretto.key | sudo gpg --dearmor  -o /usr/share/keyrings/corretto.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/corretto.gpg] https://apt.corretto.aws stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/corretto.sources.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install java-common java-11-amazon-corretto-jdk
```

Install Cassandra:
```bash
wget -qO - https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS | sudo gpg --dearmor  -o /usr/share/keyrings/cassandra-archive.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cassandra-archive.gpg] https://debian.cassandra.apache.org 40x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cassandra
```

Install Elasticsearch:
```bash
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install elasticsearch
```

**4. Installing TheHive**

Finally, install TheHive:

```bash
wget -O- https://archives.strangebee.com/keys/strangebee.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/strangebee-archive-keyring.gpg
echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/strangebee-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.strangebee.com thehive-5.2 main' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/strangebee.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y thehive
```

Now that you’ve set up Windows 10, Wazuh, and TheHive, it’s time to configure and automate the SOC workflow. Check out the next part of this series [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-09-12-soc_config %}) where we’ll configure these tools and achieving full SOC automation. 

Happy Learning!
