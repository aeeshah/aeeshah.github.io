As someone passionate about cybersecurity, I’ve always been drawn to the practical side of things. Instead of just reading about concepts, I prefer diving into hands-on projects that bring those concepts to life. And what better way to learn than by setting up your own Security Operations Center (SOC) environment?

In this blog series, I’ll walk you through my journey as I set up and automate tools like `Wazuh`, `TheHive`, and `Shuffle`. These are essential in monitoring and responding to security incidents.  Here, I'll cover the installation of the tools and machines needed for this project. Let’s get started!

### The Big Picture: What We’re Building

Before diving into the setups, let me give you an idea of what this project will look like once everything is in place:

1. **Windows 10 Client Wazuh Agent**: This machine collects security-related events (logs, network activity, etc.) and sends them to the Wazuh Manager.
2. **Wazuh Manager**: Acts as a hub, analyzing and normalizing events from the Windows 10 machine and generating alerts for potential threats.
3. **Shuffle**: Enriches these alerts by correlating the data with threat intelligence platforms (think VirusTotal).
4. **TheHive**: Where incidents get investigated and managed by the SOC team.
5. **SOC Analyst’s Workflow**: Alerts flow to the SOC Analyst, who receives them via email or TheHive for further analysis and response.

It’s essentially an automated workflow where security incidents are tracked from detection to investigation and response. Sounds cool, right?

### Setting Up Our Virtual Lab

To bring this project to life, we’ll set up virtual machines for Windows, and utilize cloud services for Wazuh and TheHive. For this project, I will be using Virtual Box for windows and Digital Ocean fo Wazuh and TheHive.

Let’s start with the setup process!

### Step 1: Installing Windows 10 on VirtualBox

For our SOC environment, we will need a **Windows 10/11** VM to simulate the client environment. There are many online tutorials that show how to setup and create one such as this [article](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/198427-how-to-install-windows-10-in-a-virtual-machine) for Windows 10 and this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/CNFxFdMT7Kg) for Windows 11. Follow the tutorial carefully to sucessfully setup Windows on virtual Machine.

### Step 2: Installing Sysmon

Once Windows 10 is installed, you can proceed with setting up sysmon on the virtual machine. Sysmon (System Monitor) is a powerful tool for logging system events. Here’s how I installed it on the Windows VM:

1. Download Sysmon from [Sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon).

2. Then head to github and grab a pre-made config file to ensure we’re collecting all relevant data. The config file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/blob/master/sysmonconfig.xml)

3. Copy the config.xml file to the Sysmon folder downloaded and enter the folder in Powershell.

4. Run the following command in `PowerShell (as Administrator)`:

   ```
   .\Sysmon64a.exe -accepteula -i .\sysmonconfig.xml
   ```

     ![Sysmon Installation](/assets/images/SOC/soc5.png)
        _Sysmon Installation on Windows 10_

5. To confirm that Sysmon is installed, look for the Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows >
Sysmon > Operational folder in the Event Viewer.

     ![Sysmon confirmation](/assets/images/SOC/soc6.png){: w="400" h="200" }
        _Sysmon confirmation on Windows 10_

After confirming that Sysmon is installed, it’s time to set up the cloud components!

### Step 3: Setting Up Wazuh and Thehive on Digital Ocean

**1. Creating the droplets**

We need to create 2 droplets, one for Wazuh and one for TheHive. Both droplets will have these specifications:
- 8 GB Memory
- 2 Intel vCPUs
- 160 GB Disk
- Region: Where you currently reside 
- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 (LTS) x64

![Creating Droplets](/assets/images/SOC/droplets.png)
        _Creating Droplets_

**2. Installing Wazuh**

Now we proceed to SSH into our machine. Once connected, update the ubuntu machine using this command 

```bash
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y 
```

Once completed,iInstall Wazuh with the following commands:
```bash
sudo curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
```
After installation, you’ll receive credentials to access the Wazuh dashboard:

  ![WAZUH installation](/assets/images/SOC/soc7.png)
        _WAZUH installation on AWS Ubuntu_

```
INFO: You can access the web interface https://<wazuh-dashboard-ip>
 User: admin
 Password: <ADMIN_PASSWORD>
```

>The passwords also can be found in the ‘wazuh-install-files.tar’ file.
{: .prompt-info} 

![WAZUH page](/assets/images/SOC/soc8.png){: w="400" h="200" }
 _WAZUH welcome page on AWS Ubuntu_

Now that Wazuh is installed onto the Wazuh server, it’s time to install TheHive on our TheHive server. 

### Step 4: Setting Up TheHive on Digital Ocean

**1. Connecting and Installing Dependencies**

SSH into theHive server and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget gnupg apt-transport-https git ca-certificates ca-certificates-java curl software-properties-common python3-pip lsb-release
```
This dependencies are a pre-requisite step before installing applications like TheHive, Elasticsearch, or other development tools.

**3. Installing Java, Cassandra, and Elasticsearch**

Install Java:
```bash
wget -qO- https://apt.corretto.aws/corretto.key | sudo gpg --dearmor  -o /usr/share/keyrings/corretto.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/corretto.gpg] https://apt.corretto.aws stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/corretto.sources.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install java-common java-11-amazon-corretto-jdk
```

Install Cassandra:
```bash
wget -qO - https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS | sudo gpg --dearmor  -o /usr/share/keyrings/cassandra-archive.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cassandra-archive.gpg] https://debian.cassandra.apache.org 40x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cassandra
```

Install Elasticsearch:
```bash
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install elasticsearch
```

**4. Installing TheHive**

Finally, install TheHive:

```bash
wget -O- https://archives.strangebee.com/keys/strangebee.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/strangebee-archive-keyring.gpg
echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/strangebee-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.strangebee.com thehive-5.2 main' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/strangebee.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y thehive
```
## Configuring The Hive.

To configure `The Hive` for use, first we will need to make some changes to Cassandra, a database system used by Hive. 

### Configuring Cassandra 

- Open the configuration file with your favorite text editor (I’ll use nano for simplicity):

```bash
nano /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml

```

>Need to find a parameter quickly? Use Ctrl + W in nano, type the parameter name, and jump right to it. Saves loads of time!
{: .prompt-tip} 

- Find the `cluster_name` parameter and set it to something meaningful—this is how your SOC identifies itself within a Cassandra cluster.

  ![ckuster](/assets/images/SOC/soc9.png){: w="400" h="200" }
       

- Update the `listen_address` so Cassandra knows how to communicate with other nodes (even if there’s just one node for now). In this case the node is The Hive.

  ![listenadd](/assets/images/SOC/soc10.png){: w="400" h="200" }


- The `rpc_address` is where clients will connect to Cassandra. Let’s make sure it matches the node’s IP address.

    ![rpc](/assets/images/SOC/soc11.png){: w="400" h="200" }
       
Now that we’ve tailored Cassandra’s config, let’s save the file (Ctrl + O to save, Ctrl + X to exit), and also by clearing the old data with rm -rf, we ensure the new configuration takes full effect without any residual interference. Use the following command to stop the service, remove the files and restart the service.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop cassandra
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra/*
sudo systemctl start cassandra
```

### Configuring Elasticsearch — The Search Wizard of Your SOC

With Cassandra ready, next up is Elasticsearch, which powers fast data indexing and searching. Elasticsearch will be TheHive’s best friend when it comes to retrieving critical incident information in a flash.

Here’s how we get Elasticsearch ready for action:

- As before, open the Elasticsearch configuration file with nano or your preferred editor

```bash
sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
```
- Just like Cassandra, Elasticsearch needs its own identity. Set `cluster.name` to a suitable name that reflects your SOC

- Next, configure the `network.host` to ensure Elasticsearch listens on the right IP address (TheHive’s server IP)

- Elasticsearch communicates via HTTP on port 9200. Make sure this port is correctly set.

 ![elasticsearch](/assets/images/SOC/soc12.png){: w="400" h="200" }

Once you’ve made the changes, save the file, exit, and fire up Elasticsearch using the following;

```bash
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
```

### Grant TheHive the Permissions It Needs

Now that Cassandra and Elasticsearch are configured, we need to ensure TheHive has the necessary permissions to store and manage data. Run the following command to make sure the thehive user has the correct ownership of its directories:

```bash
sudo chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thp
```
Why does this matter? Without proper ownership, TheHive might run into permission issues when writing data or managing logs. Let’s avoid that headache!

### Configuring TheHive — The Brain of Your SOC
Now that Cassandra and Elasticsearch are in full swing, it's time to breathe life into TheHive itself. TheHive is your SOC’s central intelligence unit, where incident management, investigations, and collaboration come together.

Let’s configure TheHive to communicate seamlessly with Cassandra and Elasticsearch and set it up for SOC automation.

We need to tweak a few parameters in TheHive’s configuration to ensure it talks to the right services:
- Open the application.conf file using your preferred editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/thehive/application.conf
```
- You’ll need to change several key settings here:

1. Under storage set:
    - Hostname: 'TheHive_ip'
    - cluster-name: SOC
    - Keyspace: thehive

2. Under index.search set:
    - hostname: 'TheHive_ip'
    - index-name: thehive    

2. Under service configuration set:
    - application.baseUrl: 'TheHive_ip:9000'

 ![thehive](/assets/images/SOC/soc13.png){: w="400" h="200" }

Save your changes (Ctrl + O), and exit the editor (Ctrl + X). Start and enable The Hive using the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl start thehive
sudo systemctl enable thehive
```

If all went well, TheHive should now be up and running! Launch your web browser and navigate to:

```bash
http://YOUR_THEHIVE_ADDRESS:9000/
```
You’ll be greeted with a login screen. Use the default credentials to log in for the first time:

Username: admin@thehive.local
Password: secret

 ![hivelogin](/assets/images/SOC/soc14.png){: w="400" h="200" }

>Security Tip: Change this default password as soon as you log in to keep your SOC secure!
{: .prompt-tip} 


## Configuring WAZUH

To configure WAZUH, First we login to Wazuh on “https://”Wazuh_IP”, with the admin credentials we got from the installation.

>If you don’t have the password, SSH into Wazuh server, extract the files from wazuh-install-files.tar with tar -xvf wazuh-install-files.tar and check the file wazuh-passwords.txt.
{: .prompt-tip} 

After opening Wazuh, we need to add agents. The Wazuh agent is a key component of the Wazuh security platform, designed to collect and analyze security-related data from various endpoints.

- Click `Add agent`
- Select `Windows` as `agent OS`, 
- Input `Wazuh_IP` as `Server address` 
- Name the agent in the `agent name` field.

 ![deploywazuh](/assets/images/SOC/soc15.png){: w="400" h="200" }

- A command will be generated at Step 4. This command will be used to download and install the Wazuh agent software on your host, while configuring its server address and agent name.

 ![install](/assets/images/SOC/soc16.png){: w="400" h="200" }

### On the Windows Host 

- Power up the Windows WM and navigate to the windows powershell and Run as Administrator.
- Paste the copied command and execute.
- Then use `net start wazuhsvc` command to start the Wazuh agent service

 ![wazuh](/assets/images/SOC/soc17.png){: w="400" h="200" }

If we go back to the Wazuh Manager dashboard and refresh it, we should see our new agent.
Now we want to send our Sysmon logs to Wazuh. 

 ![dashboard](/assets/images/SOC/soc18.png){: w="400" h="200" }

We can send any type of logs to Wazuh by adding location to the ossec.conf file.
Wazuh, by default, does not logs everything, it only logs events that match the defined rules. We can configure Wazuh to log everything by modifying the ossec.conf file. Now we want to send our Sysmon logs to Wazuh. For this open C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.conf file as Administrator on Windows 10 machine and add following lines:

```shell

<localfile>
  <location>Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</location>
  <log_format>eventchannel</log_format>
</localfile>
```

Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the changes by running the following PowerShell command as an administrator:

```shell
Restart-Service -Name Wazuh
```

### Playing Around with Wazuh

#### Using Mimikatz
As an example we will create custom rules on Wazuh to detect Mimikatz on our Windows machine. Firstly, we need to download mimikatz on our machine. Download it from this link https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz.

>To download Mimikatz, you must either disable Windows Defender or exclude the downloads folder from Microsoft Defender and disable any browser protection that may be on. Otherwise, mimikatz will get blocked.
{: .prompt-warning} 

- On Wazuh, go to Management - rules - Custom rules - Local rules.xml
- Add the following lines to the xml files

```shell 
<rule id="100002" level="15">
    <if_group>sysmon_event1</if_group>
    <field name="win.eventdata.originalFileName" type="pcre2">(?i)mimikatz\.exe</field>
    <description>Mimikatz Usage Detected</description>
    <mitre>
      <id>T1003</id>
    </mitre>
  </rule>
```

- Note: Custom rule IDs should start from 100000. Level: shows severity levels of events. Level 15 is the most critical. We set the originalFileName to mimikatz.exe. Even though, if attackers change the name, the original name will still be able to detect and report it.

- Now lets run Mimikatz on our client vm and check our wazuh dashboard:

    ![mimikatz](/assets/images/SOC/mimikatz.png){: w="400" h="200" }

- Now on the Wazuh Security event dashboard and HOORAY! A alerts popped up on our security events dashboard and it’s the custom rule we made to detect mimikatz usage.

    ![eventDashboard](/assets/images/SOC/soc19.png){: w="400" h="200" }

#### Using Atomic Red Team

Atomic Red Team is an open-source initiative that offers a framework for conducting security tests and simulating threats. It includes tools and techniques to replicate different attack scenarios and security risks, such as malware, phishing attempts, and network breaches.

Follow these steps to install the Atomic Red Team PowerShell module on a Windows 10 system using PowerShell with administrator privileges:

1. Modify the default PowerShell execution policy by running the following command:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```
2. Install the ART execution framework with the command:
   ```powershell
   IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/master/install-atomicredteam.ps1' -UseBasicParsing);
   Install-AtomicRedTeam -getAtomics -Force
   ```
3. Import the ART module:
   ```powershell
   Import-Module "C:\AtomicRedTeam\invoke-atomicredteam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psd1" -Force
   ```
4. To display a list of all available tests, use the following command:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-AtomicTest All -ShowDetailsBrief
   ```
**Emulating Attack Techniques with Atomic Red Team: A Deep Dive**

When it comes to testing your security defenses, Atomic Red Team is an invaluable resource. It offers a variety of testing techniques, or "Atomics," which are designed based on the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. These techniques simulate real-world attacks, helping you understand and defend against them.

For example, T1548.002 technique which focuses on "Abusing Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Account Control (UAC)." Running the following command:

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1548.002
```

simulates how adversaries might bypass UAC to escalate privileges on a system. UAC typically limits program actions unless the user grants administrator-level permissions, but attackers can exploit this mechanism to run privileged tasks without authorization. Atomic Red Team will test all possible bypass methods for this technique, providing a robust simulation.

Going back to Wazuh for monitoring, you'll notice security events related to this technique. 

 ![redteam](/assets/images/SOC/soc20.png){: w="400" h="200" }

Expanding each event, you can gain deeper insights into the details of the attempted bypass, helping to fine-tune your defenses.

 ![attack](/assets/images/SOC/soc21.png){: w="400" h="200" }

**Don't Forget Cleanup!**

After running tests, cleaning up the environment is crucial. Each test can leave behind footprints that could affect your system if not removed. Thankfully, the `Invoke-AtomicRedTeam` module offers a convenient `Cleanup` parameter to revert any changes made during testing. Here's how you can ensure a clean system post-test:

```powershell
Invoke-AtomicTest T1548.002 -Cleanup
```
By doing so, you keep your system tidy while emulating various attack techniques. This balance between testing and maintenance is key to effective security practice.

### Streamlining Security Automation with Shuffle: Integrating Wazuh, VirusTotal, and TheHive**

### Step 1: Setting Up Shuffle
First, you'll need to create an account on [shuffler.io](https://shuffler.io). Once you’ve logged in, you’ll see a page like this:

 ![shuffle](/assets/images/SOC/soc22.png){: w="400" h="200" }

1. Click on **Workflows** at the top, then select **New Workflow**.
2. Name your workflow, add a description, and select a use case. Once done, you’ll be greeted with a new page.

Now, drag and drop the **Webhook** from the left menu, give it a name, and copy the generated URL. This webhook URL will later be added to the `ossec.conf` file in Wazuh.

 ![webhook](/assets/images/SOC/webhook.png){: w="400" h="200" }

**What is a Webhook?**  
A webhook is a way for web applications to send real-time data to other systems as soon as an event occurs. Unlike traditional APIs that require polling, webhooks push the data immediately, allowing instant processing.

Next, we’ll customize the workflow. Click on the **Change Me** icon, remove the "Hello World" message, and hit the **+** button. Select **Execution Argument** to proceed.

### Step 2: Wazuh Integration
To integrate Wazuh with Shuffle, modify your `ossec.conf` file as follows:

```xml
<integration>
  <name>mimikatz_alert</name>
  <hook_url>YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE</hook_url>
  <alert_format>json</alert_format>
  <rule_id>100002</rule_id>
</integration>
```

Note: Ensure proper indentation in your configuration. Here, we’re using rule ID `100002` for Mimikatz detection, and alerts will be sent in JSON format. Once this is done, restart the Wazuh manager:

```bash
systemctl restart wazuh-manager
```

Now, run Mimikatz on your Windows machine to generate an alert. Head back to Shuffle and **Start** the process. Click on the person icon and select **Test Workflow**. You'll see the execution in action.

Expand the **Execution Argument** to view all the data generated from Wazuh. This confirms that Wazuh successfully sent the Mimikatz alert to Shuffle.

### Step 3: Extracting Hashes and VirusTotal Integration
Our next step is to extract the SHA hash from the Mimikatz alert and check its reputation on VirusTotal. To do this, we’ll use regex:

 ![virus](/assets/images/SOC/soc23.png){: w="400" h="200" }

1. Click **Change Me**, select **Regex Capture Group** from the **Find Actions** menu.
2. Select **hashes** from the Execution Argument and use this regex:
   ```regex
   SHA256=([0–9A-Fa-f]{64})
   ```

Refresh the page, and voila—you've extracted the SHA256 hash! 

Now, let's send this hash to VirusTotal for a reputation check:

1. Create a VirusTotal account to get your API key.
2. Back in Shuffle, activate VirusTotal and drag it into your workflow.
3. Choose **Get a Hash Report** instead of "Get a Domain Report."
4. Paste your API key, authenticate VirusTotal, and select the appropriate fields.

After refreshing the workflow, click on the most recent update. You’ll see the results: VirusTotal confirms if the file is malicious. In our case, 64 scanners flagged it. Success!

 ![sucess](/assets/images/SOC/soc24.jpg){: w="400" h="200" }

### Step 4: TheHive Integration
Let’s now integrate TheHive to manage alerts:

 ![shuffle](/assets/images/SOC/soc25.png){: w="400" h="200" }

1. Activate TheHive in Shuffle and connect it to VirusTotal.
2. Log in to TheHive with default credentials, create a new organization, and set up two users—one normal and one service user.
3. Generate an API key for the service user, then log out and sign in with the normal user.

Go back to Shuffle and authenticate TheHive using the API key you created. Now, configure the alert fields:

1. **Title**: `$exec.title`
2. **Tags**: `["T1003"]` (for MITRE ATT&CK Credential Dumping)
3. **Description**: `Mimikatz detected on host:$exec.text.win.system.computer from user:$exec.text.win.eventdata.user`
4. **Severity**: 2  
5. And more...

Once everything is set, open up your firewall on port 9000 temporarily. Test the workflow again, and check TheHive dashboard. You’ll see the alert successfully created! 🎉

### Step 5: Sending Email Notifications
Lastly, let’s configure email notifications to alert us about Mimikatz detections:

1. Select the **Email** app from the left menu and connect it to VirusTotal.
2. Fill in the necessary fields:
   - **Body**: `$exec.text.win.eventdata.utcTime`
   - **Title**: `$exec.title`
   - **Host**: `$exec.text.win.system.computer`
   - **User**: `$exec.text.win.eventdata.user`

Run the workflow, and you'll receive an email notification about the alert. 

 ![email](/assets/images/SOC/email.jpg){: w="400" h="200" }

### Conclusion
By integrating Wazuh, VirusTotal, and TheHive with Shuffle, we’ve built an efficient and automated security workflow that alerts us in real-time, enriches the data, and manages it in a centralized platform. Whether you're detecting Mimikatz or any other threat, this setup provides a streamlined and highly effective approach to securing your environment.

Happy learning!
